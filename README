NAME
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::InsertCodeOutput - Insert the output of Perl code
    into your POD

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.01 of
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::InsertCodeOutput (from Perl distribution
    Dist-Zilla-Plugin-InsertCodeOutput), released on 2014-12-12.

SYNOPSIS
    In dist.ini:

     [InsertCodeOutput]

    In your POD:

     # CODE: require MyLib; MyLib::gen_stuff("some", "param");

DESCRIPTION
    This module finds "# CODE: ..." directives in your POD, evals the
    specified Perl code while capturing the output using Capture::Tiny's
    "capture_merged" (which means STDOUT and STDERR output are both
    captured). If eval fails ($@ is true), build will be aborted.

SEE ALSO
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::InsertCodeResult which is similar and uses the same
    "# CODE" directive, but instead of inserting output, will insert the
    result of the code (which can be a reference, in which case will be
    dumped using Data::Dump).
